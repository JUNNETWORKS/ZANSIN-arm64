What does 'ZANSIN' mean?
========

Hearing the word "***ZANS(H)IN***", many Japanese people might imagine "***斬新*** (zanshin)" meanings "beyond common sense",  "eccentric", or "innovative". 

However, "***ZANS(H)IN***" also has a different meaning in the world of Japanese martial arts. 
That's "***残心*** (zanshin)"!!

# 残心

 ***残心*** is written with the kanji for "remaining (残)" and "mind (心)”, signifying "not being careless with both mind and body" or in other words, "not neglecting vigilance".

In Japanese martial arts, you are required to remain vigilant even after making an offensive move, prepared for a counterattack while maintaining relaxation and concentration.

Similarly, in the world of cybersecurity, it is necessary to always maintain vigilance against attacks and prepare for future threats.

For this reason, we named our training tool "***ZANSIN***".

This will lead to "unconscious vigilance," preparing you for the next emerging threats.
